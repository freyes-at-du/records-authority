# Records Authority #

Records Authority is an open source web application designed to manage structured and reusable metadata about records and record systems. The software is a lightweight and inexpensive tool used to survey departments; inventory records; and create, manage, and distribute retention schedules.

The tool allows users to:
  * Standardize and streamline the survey and interview process for conducting records inventories
  * Facilitate the creation, maintenance, and delivery of retention schedules
  * Organize information about records for easy search and retrieval
  * Create and manage record-related metadata for interoperability and long-term use in other systems

Initial funding for the development of Records Authority was provided by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. The software was originally developed at the University of Denver in Denver, CO.
